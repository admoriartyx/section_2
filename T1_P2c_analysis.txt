The patterns that emerged  in the plot are rather similar even though the point clouds were expanded. Jarvis still had the longest runtimes and the Graham Scan still had the quickest. What stood out to me, however, was the Jarvis data pivoted at the same places, specifically at n=100,800. There were slight plateaus in the runtimes as opposed to regressions as n increased, but overall the stature of both data sets were similar. Again, the climbs of Quickhull and Graham Scan were steady and close to one another.
Therefore, it would seem that the runtime does not heavily rely on the variance of the point clouds.
