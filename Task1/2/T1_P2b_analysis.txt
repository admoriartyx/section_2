Even though I had to omit the Monotone Chain data from the program, the results were still very telling. The Jarvis March program skyrocketed relative to Graham scan and Quickhull, though the runtime for n=100 was surprisingly higher than the runtime for n=200. There was also a dropoff in runtime from 800 to 1000. This was unique to Jarvis, as the other two programs climed more steadily but always increased with larger n data size. The fastest program, as predicted, was the Graham Scan.
