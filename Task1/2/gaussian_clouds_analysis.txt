The runtimes were again similar, but the Jarvis runtimes climbed slightly steeper with this data set. Also, the Graham algorithm ultimately took longer than the Quickhull for the first time following around n=400. Jarvis script does once again have the same pivot points at n=100,800 but both are just slight plateaus and the runtimes increase at a steeper rate again after. In comparing all of the charts so far, I so no significant difference in the trajectories of the individual algorithms across different point clouds. Even the scalings of the y axes have not changed drastically, so I am still sticking to the idea that variance in the data sets does not influence the runtime of the convex hulls.
